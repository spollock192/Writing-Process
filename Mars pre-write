Mars: A Rover History

A topic I have always wanted to learn more about is the Mars missions. While I have followed Curiosity's time on the red planet, I have
never learned about the other rovers that have succeeded and failed in the past. Through this paper I hope to gain a better understanding
of the strategies used to launch and land such tools of science and exploration as well as the political history behind them.

The USSR was the first nation to put a spacecraft on Mars back in 1971 which was a crash-landing and didnâ€™t send back any useful
information but was a historical moment regardless. The USSR sent many orbiters and attempts and landers to Mars but was never successful
in landing on the surface. The first lander to survive entry was the Viking 1 which landed in 1976, this was also the first American
mission to Mars and held the record for longest lasting lander for 34 years. Spirit and Opportunity which landed in 2004 were mobile and
amassed a large amount of data through their time on Mars. Opportunity is still active well past its expected lifetime, proving the
importance of well-engineered tools. Curiosity, which landed in 2012, is the newest addition to the Mars rovers and focuses on habitability
of Mars for human life. If all goes well, NASA hope to send human astronauts to Mars in the 2030's which wouldnt be possible without the
knowledge gained from these missions.

These science missions to the red planet allow us to study one of our closest planetary neighbors for the benefit of mankind. By observing
the geology and climate of Mars we can see how it will be possible to put humans there safely in the future. The research on Mars helps
scientists better understand our solar system as a whole and how we can improve life on Earth and beyond.
