A topic I have always wanted to learn more about is the Mars missions. While I have followed Curiosity's time on the red planet I have never learned about the other rovers that have succeeded and failed in the past. Through this paper I hope to gain a better understanding of the stratagies used to launch and land such tools of science and exploration as well as the political history behind them.
The USSR was the first nation to put a spacecraft on Mars back in 1971. This was a crashlanding and didnt send back any useful information but was a historical moment regardless. The first lander to survive entry was the viking 1 which landed in 1976. This was also the first american mission to mars and held the record for longest lasting lander for 34 years. Spirit and Opportunity which landed in 2004 were mobile and were able to amass a large amount of data through their time on Mars. Opportunity is still active well past its expected lifetime, proving the importance of well engineered tools. The Curiosity, which landed in 2012, is the newest addition to the mars rovers and focuses on habitability of mars for human life.
These science missions to the red planet allow us to study one of our closest planetary neighbors for the benefit of mankind. By observing the geology and climate of Mars we can see how it will be possible to put humans there safely in the future. The research on mars helps scientists better understand our solarsystem as a whole and how we can improve life on Earth and beyond.
